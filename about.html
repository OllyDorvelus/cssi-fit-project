      <p>Hi, I'm Cayla! I am a student of Google's Computer Science Summer Institute,
        which has been an amazing experience to prepare myself for college. I am an
        incoming freshman at Georgia Tech, where I intend to major in Computer Science.
        When I am not coding, I enjoy running (quite a lot), and I'll also occasionally
        cross train biking or doing yoga.

      <p>Hey! My name is Jolines Contreras, I live in Brooklyn, NY and I will be attending the Grove School of Engineering at The City College of New York
    in Fall 2015. I love to play video games, watch anime, write stories, read books, watch Netflix, and of course, code. CSSI has been an amazing experience so far
    and I've met a ton of new people. When I'm not on my computer, I do yoga, and do capoeira for fun with friends. I plan to join the fencing team in college.</p>
