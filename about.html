    <p>Hey! My name is Jolines Contreras, I live in Brooklyn, NY and I will be attending the Grove School of Engineering at The City College of New York</br>
in Fall 2015. I love to play video games, watch anime, write stories, read books, watch Netflix, and do yoga. Before learning about Computer Science</br>
I wanted to be a writer. I loved to read and write both poetry and stories, English and History were my favorite classes, and I thought all</br>
that computer stuff was way too complicated for me. My high school had a major system and I went into the law major, thinking of becoming</br>
a lawyer. It wasn't until my junior year of high school that I thought about something geared towards engineering. I'm always on my PC</br>
playing games so I decided, why not? I started researching colleges with computer science programs at the end of my junior year. I attended</br>
my first coding workshop courtsey of CodeNow and learned Ruby on Rails in October 2014, in my senior year. I joined my school's Girls Who Code</br>
halfway through my senior year, and learned JavaScript every Thursday after school, and practiced on Khan Academy. I applied to CSSI NYC and got in!</br>
It's been an amazing experience and I just want to thank all the TAs and instructors for taking the time to make this possible. I hope all future CSSIers</br>
have as much fun as we did these last 3 weeks.</p>
