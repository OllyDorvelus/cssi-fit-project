      <p>Hi, I'm Cayla! I am a student of Google's Computer Science Summer Institute,
        which has been an amazing experience to prepare myself for college. I am an
        incoming freshman at Georgia Tech, where I intend to major in Computer Science.
        When I am not coding, I enjoy running (quite a bit), and I'll also occasionally
        cross train biking or doing yoga.

      <p>Its Olly ! I sleep, think, and breathe fitness, code, and gaming. I will be attending Indiana Tech in the Fall to study
      Software Engineering, I will also be running track as a sprinter. On my spare time, I am most likely training, coding, or gaming.
      My motto is achieve the best mental and physical health as possible, and put your best foot foward towarda anything you would like to do in life.

      <p>Hey! My name is Jolines Contreras, I live in Brooklyn, NY and I will be attending the Grove School of Engineering at The City College of New York
    in Fall 2015. I love to play video games, watch anime, write stories, read books, watch Netflix, and of course, code. CSSI has been an amazing experience so far
    and I've met a ton of new people. When I'm not on my computer, I do yoga, and do capoeira for fun with friends. I plan to join the fencing team in college.</p>
